Vertical Tabs 2
===============

A fork of https://github.com/darrinhenein/VerticalTabs that reduces the tab bar to only display favicons and fixes some issues that crop up at narrow widths.

Download & Install from the releases page: https://github.com/lonnen/VerticalTabs-2/releases/

Developing
----------

1. Edit some files
2. `make`
3. drag 'n drop `VerticalTabs.xpi` into Firefox to install and test

For best results, use a new FF profile for testing or at least purge old versions of VerticalTabs before trying a fresh build.
